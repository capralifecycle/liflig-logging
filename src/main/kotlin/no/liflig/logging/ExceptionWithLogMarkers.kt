/**
 * Interface to allow you to attach [log markers][LogMarker] to exceptions. When passing a `cause`
 * exception to one of the methods on [Logger], it will check if the given exception implements this
 * interface, and if it does, these log markers will be attached to the log.
 *
 * This is useful when you are throwing an exception from somewhere down in the stack, but do
 * logging further up the stack, and you have structured data that you want to attach to the logged
 * exception. In this case, one may typically resort to string concatenation, but this interface
 * allows you to have the benefits of structured logging for exceptions as well.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * import no.liflig.logging.Logger
 * import no.liflig.logging.WithLogMarkers
 * import no.liflig.logging.marker
 *
 * class InvalidUserData(user: User) : RuntimeException(), WithLogMarkers {
 *   override val message = "Invalid user data"
 *   override val logMarkers = listOf(marker("user", user))
 * }
 *
 * fun storeUser(user: User) {
 *   if (!user.isValid()) {
 *     throw InvalidUserData(user)
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * private val log = Logger {}
 *
 * fun example(user: User) {
 *   try {
 *     storeUser(user)
 *   } catch (e: Exception) {
 *     log.error {
 *       cause = e
 *       "Failed to store user"
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `log.error` would then give the following log output (using `logstash-logback-encoder`), with
 * the `user` log marker from `InvalidUserData` attached:
 * ```
 * {
 *   "message": "Failed to store user",
 *   "user": {
 *     "id": 1,
 *     "name": "John Doe"
 *   },
 *   "stack_trace": "...",
 *   // ...timestamp etc.
 * }
 * ```
