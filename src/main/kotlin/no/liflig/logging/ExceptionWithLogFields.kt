/**
 * Base exception class to allow you to attach [log fields][LogField] to exceptions. When passing a
 * `cause` exception to one of the methods on [Logger], it will check if the given exception is an
 * instance of this class, and if it is, these fields will be added to the log.
 *
 * The exception also includes any log fields from [withLoggingContext], from the scope in which the
 * exception is constructed. This way, we don't lose any logging context if the exception escapes
 * the context it was thrown from. If you don't want this behavior, you can create a custom
 * exception and implement the [WithLogFields] interface.
 *
 * This class is useful when you are throwing an exception from somewhere down in the stack, but do
 * logging further up the stack, and you have structured data that you want to attach to the
 * exception log. In this case, one may typically resort to string concatenation, but this class
 * allows you to have the benefits of structured logging for exceptions as well.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * import no.liflig.logging.ExceptionWithLogFields
 * import no.liflig.logging.field
 * import no.liflig.logging.getLogger
 *
 * private val log = getLogger {}
 *
 * fun example(event: OrderUpdateEvent) {
 *   try {
 *     processOrderUpdate(event)
 *   } catch (e: Exception) {
 *     log.error(e) { "Failed to process order update event" }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * fun processOrderUpdate(event: OrderUpdateEvent) {
 *   withLoggingContext(field("event", event)) {
 *     val order = getOrder(event.orderId)
 *
 *     if (!order.canBeUpdated()) {
 *       throw ExceptionWithLogFields(
 *           "Received update event for finalized order",
 *           field("order", order),
 *       )
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `log.error` would then give the following log output (using `logstash-logback-encoder`), with
 * both the `order` field from the exception and the `event` field from the logging context:
 * ```
 * {
 *   "message": "Failed to process order update event",
 *   "stack_trace": "...ExceptionWithLogFields: Received update event for finalized order...",
 *   "order": { ... },
 *   "event": { ... },
 *   // ...timestamp etc.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Constructors
 *
 * `ExceptionWithLogFields` provides 4 constructor overloads:
 * - `(message: String?, logFields: List<LogField>, cause: Throwable?)`
 *     - Primary constructor taking an exception message, a list of log fields and an optional cause
 *       exception
 * - `(message: String?, vararg logFields: LogField, cause: Throwable?)`
 *     - Takes log fields as varargs, so you don't have to wrap them in a list
 *     - To pass `cause`, use a named parameter
 * - `(logFields: List<LogField>, cause: Throwable?)`
 *     - Defaults `message` to `cause.message`. This lets you:
 *         - Wrap a cause exception with log fields, and use the cause exception's message
 *         - Extend `ExceptionWithLogFields` and override `message`, without having to pass it
 *           through the constructor
 * - `(vararg logFields: LogField, cause: Throwable?)`
 *     - Combines the two previous constructors, to let you extend `ExceptionWithLogFields` and
 *       override `message` while also passing log fields as varargs
